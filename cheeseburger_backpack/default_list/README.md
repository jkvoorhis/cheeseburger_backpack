The file `default_words.txt` contains slurs and linguistic microagressions 
re: 

* ableism
* (more to come).

The two are not separated in this file as they are listed alphabetically.

It heavily borrows from the 
[Glossary of Ableist Phrases][ableism-language-post] by Lydia X. Z. Brown and to
reiterate some important notes from their post:

These notes are specifically worded for ableist language (the topic of the 
original post), but the sentiments apply for all identities referenced by the 
words in the list.

This list is open for expansion and revision. Please submit a PR with additional
words for which you would like to see usage numbers in your Slack organization. 
Alternatively you can compose your own word set to use with this script and 
provide it as an argument on the command line.
